# PickPal #

## Summary ##
PickPal is an app to help you make decisions! Not sure where to eat? Need a suggestion for a good bar? Use PickPal and you'll get a curated small set of options to make a pick! Spend more time enjoying yourself than juggling too many options.

## Problem ##
Studies have shown that consumers who are offered too many choices are left unhappier when making a choice. PickPal makes the burden of too many choices less intimidating.

## Solution ##
PickPal gives users a small number of choices and a short time-limit to make a decision. No worries if time runs out; a random choice will be made.

## How to Get Started ##
Enter your location, pick what you're looking for, and choose a spot to visit!
